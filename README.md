# Python Data Analysis: Heights & Heart Disease

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to two Python programming exercises focused on statistical analysis and data visualization.

---

## Exercise 1: Height Data Analysis

This task simulates and analyzes a normally distributed dataset of human heights using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy. It includes:

- Generation of height data
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std)
- Histogram visualization
- Percentile calculations
- Outlier detection using the 1.5 * IQR rule
- Random sampling
- Hypothesis testing
- Probability estimation for values above a threshold

Test functions are included to verify the correctness of implemented methods.

## Exercise 2: Heart Disease Dataset Analysis

This task explores a real-world heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Using pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn, the project investigates:

- Gender-wise heart disease prevalence
- Cholesterol level comparisons based on disease presence and gender
- Age distribution of affected individuals via histograms
- Box plot analysis of heart rate vs. heart disease
- Bar chart showing relationship between exercise-induced angina and heart disease


## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- PDF tools (for report)
